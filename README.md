# AMultimodal Metaphorical Dataset for Emotion Classification and a Novel Method by Chain of Thought Prompt

We release our Dataset, a multimodal metaphorical emotion dataset in chinese consisting of 5000 pairs of text and images, with annotations indicating the presence of metaphors, target domain, source domain and emotion categories. In addition we propose a  novel methodology  employing chain-of-thought prompt for source domain and target domain of metaphor.
Our dataset is presented in the DataALL.xlsx file.

## Example Instance

.<div align='center'><img src='Ansample_cn.png' width="600" height="200"></div>

In this example, words are arranged to form a hand giving a thumbs-up, expressing appreciation for civilized behavior. Therefore, the target domain is words, the source domain is the hand, and the sentiment is trust.

## Annotation Guideline


* Our annotators identify incongruent units by examining the text and visual elements, often indicating the presence of metaphors. 
* They identify these incongruent units and interpret the irreversible "A is B" identity relationship to recognize metaphorical text-image pairs.
* By determining the primary theme that a sample intends to convey, one selects one of the two entities as the target domain, with the other entity describing the target domain referred to as the source domain.
* They identify the most appropriate emotion.




## Data Format


| Key                     |                                    Value                                    |
|-------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `Img_id`            |                The address of the image to be identified                  |
| `Img_url`            |                The URL for downloading the image                  |
| `Text`     |                                          The  text in the image                              |
| `Metaphor`|           Metaphorical judgment (0: Literal ; 1: Metaphor)          |
| `Target domain`|           Target domain in the metaphorical sample         |
| `Source domain`|           Source domain in the metaphorical sample          |
| `Emotion`            |                      The emotion of the metaphorical sample(1joy ; 2love ; 3trust ; 4fear ; 5sadness ; 6disgust ; 7anger ; 8surprise ; 9anticipation ; 10neutral)                 |
